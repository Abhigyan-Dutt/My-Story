As the bell rang and the students filed into the classroom, little Abhigyan felt his heart rate start to rise. He knew what was coming next - the noise. Lots and lots of noise. Every day, the kids in his class seemed to get louder and louder, and it was starting to wear on his nerves.

Abhigyan was an emotional child, and he struggled to keep his feelings in check. When the noise got too much for him, he would often lash out in anger, slamming his fists on the desk or shouting at his classmates. It wasn't that he wanted to be mean, but the noise just made him feel so frustrated and overwhelmed.

His teacher, Mrs. Dinky, had tried to help him. She had given him earplugs and let him sit in a quieter part of the room, but nothing seemed to work. Abhigyan just couldn't get away from the noise.

One day, as the class was working on a group project, the noise level in the room hit an all-time high. Abhigyan's head was pounding, and he could feel tears welling up in his eyes. Suddenly, he snapped. He stood up from his desk and shouted at the top of his lungs, "Will you all just be quiet? I can't take it anymore!"

The room fell silent, and all eyes turned to Abhigyan. He felt embarrassed and ashamed, but at the same time, he felt relieved. He had finally said what he had been feeling for so long.

Dinky came over to him and put a hand on his shoulder. "It's okay, Abhigyan," she said. "I know it's hard for you. Let's take a break and go for a walk outside."

As they walked around the schoolyard, Abhigyan felt the tension in his body start to ease. Dinky listened as he talked about how hard it was for him to concentrate with all the noise, and how he felt like nobody understood.

From that day on, Dinky made a special effort to create a quieter environment for Abhigyan. She put up sound-dampening panels in the classroom and encouraged the other students to be more mindful of their noise levels. Abhigyan still struggled with his emotions at times, but he knew that he had a teacher who cared and understood.

And that made all the difference.
